# Alcohol-Classification
* Classification of alcohols obtained by QCM sensors with different characteristics using Artificial neural networks. The use of gas sensors together with pattern classification methods plays a significant role in the recognition and classification of chemical compounds and the detection of their harmful effects. Designing these less costly systems is important also for the industry. Alcohols constitute a huge portion of these compounds and are used largely in hygiene products and cosmetics. In this study, 5 different types of alcohols – 1-octanol, 1-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, and 1-isobutanol – are classified using **QCM (quartz crystal microbalance) sensors of different structures.**
